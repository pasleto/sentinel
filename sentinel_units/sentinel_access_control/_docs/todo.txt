// TODO - maybe connect mcp23017 reset pin

// TODO -> add endpoints for manual restore state for tamper / sensors

// TODO -> enclosure tamper blocking
// TODO -> fire sensor handling

// TODO -> log entering / exiting config mode

// TODO -> add reason to logBoot

// ? - log NTP sync

// ! when replacing or deleting card -> what happen to log records saved on devices with the the replacing / deleting id / value

// ? - on readers maybe add variables for expected_bits (LENGTH_ANY,4,8,26,34,...) [card bit lenght] and decode_messages (true,false) [parity bits check and remove]

// ? - revert saving logic -> save events in device database first -> then try to publish with rowid -> wait for response with the rowid for delete
//   ? - if some error happen in the process -> event is still saved on device + another table is needed on backend (to save rowids of events to delete on device)
//   ? - on connect -> make request for events sync -> possible 

// ! - mqtt notify for reboot status changing
